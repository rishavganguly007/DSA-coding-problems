Hackerank Problem asked in the interview coding round of JP Morgan & Chase

1. Substring Removal

Given a string, seq, that consists of the characters 'A' and 'B' only, in one move, delete either an "AB" or a "BB" substring and
concatenate the remaining substrings.

Find the minimum possible length of the remaining string after performing any number of moves.

Note: A substring is a contiguous subsequence of a string.

Example
seq = "BABBA"

Using 0-based indexing, the following moves
are optimal.

Â· Delete the substring "AB" starting at index
1. "BABBA"-> "BBA"
. Delete the substring "BB" starting at index 0.
"BBA"-> "A"

Sample Case 1

Sample Input For Custom Testing

FUNCTION

seq = "AABBBAB"

STDIN

AABBBAB

Sample Output
